# Fixtures

`01-build` … `06-components` are worlds in the retired first protocol (`spec/history/PROTOCOL-v1.md`): each holds
a `log.jsonl` (the whole log, genesis included) and `folded.json` (the state v1's reference fold gave it). They are
old-world inputs, not conformance vectors for this protocol: the importer's gates translate them
(`tools/protocol/sweep.ts`, `tools/protocol/import-v1/snapshot-oracle.ts`, `pretrans-check.ts`) and the setup and
refused-join suites boot from `01-build`. What each exercised, in v1's words:

- `01-build`: creation, transforms, lights, a mount, and removing a parent.
- `02-swing`: sockets, reactions, an unknown component type, a motion in generous dialect, a `use`, a body mounting
  and dismounting, and an entry in a verb nobody knows.
- `03-authority`: the first joiner owning a new world; grants; the `*` wildcard.
- `04-overwrite`: the flat id namespace: a same-id `spawn` replaces the previous holder wholesale.
- `05-lightpolicy`: the light policy flags `keep` and `day`.
- `06-components`: the 2026-10-01 amendments: a lib-less `spawn` as an Empty, `light` and `collider` components.

01–04 were recorded from the v1 sequencer's websocket door; 05's and 06's `folded.json` are v1's fold of their logs.

Additional gates use separate fixture shapes:

- `replay/` holds nested sim stories and golden digests; it is not itself an
  instant-fold fixture directory.
- `ammodoll-rig.json` contains node transforms, parentage and humanoid bone
  mapping extracted from the source VRM named and SHA-256-bound inside it.
  Meshes and textures are omitted. Reproduce the extraction with
  `bun tools/extract-doll-fixture.ts path/to/mythos-wings.vrm`.
  `bun tools/ammodoll-test.ts` uses this committed skeleton and a copy with
  digit bones removed, including every wing/hair matrix assertion. Add
  `--fleet` to also test installed local avatars; that optional extension
  reports a missing library before running it.
- `sim-ground-assets.json` binds the ground-smoke offsets and bounds to
  measured source and KTX2 response hashes. The smoke hashes the response
  consumed by the browser, including negotiated/overlay variants. Before
  adding another hash, run `bun tools/ground-asset-measure.ts path/to/file.glb`
  and verify its measured geometry fits this fixture. Its source and KTX2
  variants both have 6,040 triangles and the same millimetre-rounded bounds
  and visual-center offset.
