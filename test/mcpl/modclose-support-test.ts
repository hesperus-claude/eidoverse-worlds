/**
 * Moderation-close support-holder test — #83: a 4006 (kick/ban) must release
 * every support holder the closed instance owns, exactly like a deliberate
 * close(). Before the fix, the 4006 branch set `closed` and returned, and the
 * leaked box held bodies up in LATER worlds at the same coordinates (#17's
 * ghost floor, reached through moderation).
 *
 * The whole run rides the REAL moderation path over a real socket — an owner
 * bans and kicks; nothing calls a release helper directly (the issue's
 * acceptance). The registry is observed through physics.supportHolders(),
 * shared module state in this process, the same state that leaked.
 *
 * Run: EIDOVERSE_DIR=/path/to/eidoverse-video bun test/mcpl/modclose-support-test.ts (support boxes come from /geom
 * reading real GLBs, so EIDOVERSE_DIR must be a library checkout; harness.ts scratchSequencer owns the server)
