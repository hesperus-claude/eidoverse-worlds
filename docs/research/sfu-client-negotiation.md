# The browser SFU client (client/lib/voicesfu.js): negotiation notes

Why the client half of the in-process SFU is shaped the way it is. The spec is `notes/SFU-SPEC.md`; the transceiver
behaviour below is reproducible in seconds with `tools/mini-sfu-repro.mjs`.

## The server offers, always

A browser publishing its mic offers `sendonly`, and an answer cannot add a receive direction the offer never proposed,
so a server that answered would forward into a track nobody receives. Every renegotiation is server-initiated: the
client only ever does `setRemoteDescription(offer)` → answer, and when adding a track makes it want to renegotiate it
ASKS the server to offer (no glare).

## Which transceiver the mic goes on

With anyone else in the room the client's pc holds, in order:

    [sendonly route → speakerA] [sendonly route → speakerB] [recvonly floor]

The FLOOR is the m-line the server offers to receive our mic. `addTrack` reuses the first *compatible* transceiver,
which is a speaker ROUTE, so the mic lands there (answered `a=recvonly`) and the floor is answered `a=inactive`
forever. The server (werift fires ontrack only for sendonly|sendrecv with a non-zero port) never subscribes: server
diag says `publishing:false / rxPackets:0` while the client honestly reports thousands of packets sent. It only
reproduces with 2+ people; a lone client has no routes to mis-pick.

So the hunt, in order:

1. the sender we already own (a SWAP: `replaceTrack` on the same m-line, no renegotiation);
2. the inactive floor (the first publish);
3. bare `addTrack`, only when neither exists (solo, or before the first offer).

"Already own" is decided by `currentDirection` wherever it exists, because it is what the negotiation actually agreed.
`direction` is only our ask: an `addTrack` transceiver created before the first offer can be associated by JSEP with a
speaker route and answer `currentDirection='recvonly'` while `direction` still reads `sendrecv`. `direction` is
consulted only while `currentDirection` is null (never yet negotiated).

After an offer is applied, a live outbound track that no m-line is actually sending (a publish that beat the first
offer into an occupied room) is moved to the floor and renegotiated: the stranded-publish rescue.

## Identity of inbound tracks

The server names each outbound stream after the speaker it carries (`sfu.ts` ensureRoute), so the msid welds identity
to the media. The sideband `sfu-route` queue (pairing tracks with speakers by arrival order) is only a fallback for an
older server; when both are present and disagree, msid wins and the client says so. The route subscription is made
ONCE for the module's lifetime (the bus has no `off`; a per-connect listener would desync the queue).

## ICE

- The ICE config comes from the credential (`iceServers?` in the SFU spec), so an operator can point at their own
  STUN/TURN without a client rebuild. Without STUN there is no reflexive candidate, and a peer on another network
  stalls in `checking` forever without an error. The fallback stays `[]`, so an older server's credential behaves as
  before rather than silently acquiring a public dependency.
- Candidates that arrive while the offer is still being applied are QUEUED, not dropped: `addIceCandidate` throws
  before a remote description exists, and the one viable pair on a constrained network can arrive in that window.
- Candidates carry their generation; the server refuses one that cannot prove which leg it belongs to.
- A connection that never connects SAYS so to the person: `failed`, or 8 s in `checking` (host pairs settle in well
  under a second on a LAN). `disconnected` is not failure; it is often transient. A media-only death emits
  `sfu-media-dead` and the bridge, which owns the retry budget, re-asks for a credential.

## Reconnects

A reconnect builds a new pc. The old mic stream belongs to the old pc, so it is stopped and dropped (intent, `wantMic`,
is kept) and the bridge's replay takes the real `addTrack` path. The predecessor pc is closed with its handlers nulled
first, and every handler, timer and async exchange snapshots the pc it was armed for and returns if superseded, or a
ghost pc would diagnose (and burn the recovery budget on) its healthy successor.

## Mic acquisition

- ONE ACQUISITION AT A TIME. `getUserMedia` can sit on a permission prompt for seconds, and two callers (a key press
  and the credential-time replay) can be inside it at once: two senders, a double publish, and an orphaned stream whose
  hardware light stays on after leaving. The guard is a promise (late callers await the same acquisition), tagged with
  the pc it was for; a stale one is awaited and then treated as absent, and every waiter re-checks after each await.
- RE-READ INTENT AFTER THE AWAIT: a mic toggled during the prompt means whatever arrived answers a question nobody is
  asking any more; stop it and ask the current question.
- The source comes from `voiceSource()` (the seam), not the device: the mic when wanted and available, else the synth
  provider. Mic OFF with a synth provider SWAPS the published source rather than muting the tracks; mic ON with a synth
  stream published re-acquires the real device.
- The device stream is GATED (`gateFor`) before the sender sees it; if the gate can't run the publish is refused rather
  than silently transmitting an ungated mic. Synthetic sources pass through.
- A denied permission prompt is an answer, not a crash: the intent is cleared (only by the invocation that owns it).

## Levels

The own-level analyser (`sfuMyLevel`) reads the RAW device, not the gated lane: a mouth answers "are you making sound",
and a sensitivity meter that only moves once you are over the threshold cannot help you set it.

## What the browser gives us for free

AGC, noise suppression and echo cancellation come from `getUserMedia` constraints. On receive, NetEq is the jitter
buffer: `jitterBufferTargetDelay` is its adaptive depth, inserted/removed samples its time-stretching,
`concealedSamples` its PLC. `sfuInboundStats` exposes them. (Basis, by comparison, hand-builds a serious AGC, binds
RNNoise natively, has no AEC, and carries a ~745-line jitter buffer.)
