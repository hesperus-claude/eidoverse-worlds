// autohooks — who owns what in the engine's per-frame hook array.
//
// `globalThis._autoParticleSystems` is a global the toolkit drains every frame (sky.js's
// updateAutoSystems), pushed into by the sky, the meadow and entity emitters. A subsystem that
// claims its entries by DIFFING the array around an async build would also claim a hook someone
// else registered meanwhile. Rule: a host subsystem marks the per-frame hooks it keeps, and a
// claim-by-diff skips marked hooks.
//
// DOM-free and THREE-free; unit-tested in tools/particles-test.ts.
