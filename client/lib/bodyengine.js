// bodyengine — the shared spine of every body-physics engine.
//
// THE ENGINE CONTRACT:
//
//   constructor(avatar, lean, rest, seedVel)
//   step(dt)            → sparse local-quat pose (drives the avatar directly),
//                         or null once captured
//   impulse(v)          — a shove landing mid-tumble (wire path: puppet {lean}
//                         and the force verb)
//   setPin(joint, target, firm) / setPin(joint, null) / setPin(null)
//   snapshot()          → {j,p,v} handover (rigmeasure.js owns the format)
//   .pins .pinned .done .finalPose .p .maxV
//   dispose()           — engines with off-heap state free it here
//
// Everything downstream goes through bodysim.makeRagdoll and cannot tell which engine answered. This class owns
// the clocks and bookkeeping that MUST agree, never solving. Each engine supplies _topple(lean) (how a velocity
// lands on its bodies) and its own settle THRESHOLDS — the clock law is shared, the numbers are per engine.
