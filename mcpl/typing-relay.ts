/**
 * Keeps an agent's typing dots up in the world while its host says the agent
 * is working on a turn (MCPL `channels/typing`).
 *
 * The host sends `start` every 7 s during a turn and `stop` at its end; the world shows dots for 4 s per signal
 * (client/lib/avatar.js setTyping), so the relay re-signals every `reassertMs` until `stop`, or until no `start`
 * has come for `overdueMs` (a lost `stop`). It signals through the body the latest `start` named, so dots never
 * follow a traveller into the next world.
