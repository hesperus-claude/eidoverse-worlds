// headset-seen-test: the stored headset bit is HISTORY, and says so (#197).
// Nothing clears `ew-headset-seen` when a headset is unplugged, and isSessionSupported stays optimistic after a headset
// is switched off, so a re-probe isn't honest either: the value carries WHEN, expires, and the copy claims only that a
// headset has been USED here. Drives the REAL client/lib/headset_seen.js (no imports, nothing to stub); its wiring (the
// boot backend choice, the panel copy, the time stamp's writers) is in tools/wiring-check.ts.
// Run: BUN_RUNTIME_TRANSPILER_CACHE_PATH=0 bun tools/headset-seen-test.mjs
// Mutations that must turn a named check red:
//   headset_seen.js: headsetSeenRecently ignores the TTL (always true once seen)
//   headset_seen.js: an unmigrated legacy '1' reads as recent again (the permanence defect)
//   (core.js, videopanel.js and xr.js mutations go red in tools/wiring-check.ts)
