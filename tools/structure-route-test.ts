// bun tools/structure-route-test.ts — routing over a griddled structure (shared/structure.js, shared/structure-route.js),
// renderer/server-free. A planned route never crosses an authored solid wall (a door or arch is open, a window is not, a
// diagonal is a wall), checked by tools/structure-oracle.ts apart from the planner; where no route exists it is refused
// with the router's one reason.
//   1. the route table   2. caps and the worst case   3. support bases
// The agent walks over these routes keep their own processes (structure-oracle.ts says why): structure-threshold-test
// (walkTo and the move tool), structure-route-support-test (transformed frames), route-preparation-test (the authored-plan
// cache), walk-support-lifecycle-test (how a walk ends).
