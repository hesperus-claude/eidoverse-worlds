/**
 * An in-process SFU — voice as an organ of the world server, not a service
 * beside it.
 *
 * Forward encoded Opus ourselves, in this process, so an operator runs ONE thing and voice costs them nothing.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SMALL: we terminate WebRTC server-side, so the BROWSER keeps getUserMedia → addTrack and therefore its
 * own jitter buffer, packet-loss concealment, FEC and congestion control. We forward ENCODED Opus and never decode it.
 *
 * THE BIGGEST SFU TRAP, SIDESTEPPED: mixing two sources into one track forces SSRC/sequence/timestamp rewriting. Every
 * (listener, speaker) pair gets its own track, so no rewriting exists to get wrong; it also keeps one stream per
 * speaker (client spatialization) and no server-side mixing (the MCU mistake).
 *
 * Future P2P offload, and where it plugs in: docs/research/sfu-p2p-offload.md.
 *
 * AUTHORITY: none. This file moves bytes. Who may speak, who may hear, and
 * which generation owns a leg are decided in relaydecision.ts and enforced by
 * the caller. The SFU's only enforcement is mechanical: a pair with no consent
 * is never fed, so a modified client cannot hear what the server didn't send.
