// shared/protocol/ids.js — the ONE way an entity id is minted, by the authority: writers never choose ids. An id is
// world-scoped (PROTOCOL §3.1: a thing's global name is (world id, entity id)), but forks copy ids verbatim and a merge meets
// both sides' ids, so a minted id must not collide by construction: 26 base32 characters (130 random bits; 2^-65 odds at a
// billion ids per world pair). A counter (<slug>-<count>) collides for certain across forks; 8 hex (32 bits) by the birthday
// bound (2% at 10 000 things a fork).
// OPAQUE: no readable slug, since a slug goes stale and an id never changes. What a thing is called is its label; ids already
// minted with a slug stay valid as they are. Ids stay [a-z0-9-]{1,64}.
